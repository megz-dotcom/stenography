# Image Stenography

Project : Image Stegnography using Java.

Steganography is the technique of hiding data within an ordinary, nonsecret file or message to avoid detection; the hidden data is then extracted at its destination. 
Steganography use can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. The word steganography is derived from the Greek word steganos, meaning "hidden or covered," and the Greek root graph, meaning "to write.".
